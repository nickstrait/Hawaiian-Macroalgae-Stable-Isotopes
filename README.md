# Hawaiian Macroalgae Isotopes

I have examined nitrogen stable isotopes and percent nitrogen from Hawaiian macroalgae. The objectives of this project are to: Describe and quantify δ15N and N (%) in the macroalgal tissue of representative genera from mesophotic and shallow depths across the Hawaiian Archipelago. Contrast nutrient regimes based on algal tissue between the Northwestern and Main Hawaiian Islands. Analyze the spatial variability of nutrients (δ15N and N (%)) from algal tissue across the Hawaiian Archipelago (i.e., how does it differ from Maui to Midway). Analyze the spatial variability of nutrients (δ15N and N (%)) from algal tissue across depth gradients (shallow to mesophotic depths).

Data for this project is stored in the data folder. CSV file were used for R, XLSX file is complete database. Subests.Rmd creates subsets of the main data for various analyzes. Anova's.Rmd conatains all the models. Violin Plots.Rmd and Barplots.Rmd contains plots to display the data. Decal t-tests.Rmd is an analysis for decalcified samples vs calcified samples. Martix.Rmd creates matrix for multivariant analysis.

All code is reproducable, so long as the data is imported with the same names.
